# Java Finance Application
## Overview
Hello There! <br>
You've stumbled upon a prototype application I'm developing in order to teach myself Java & better my development skill-set. This is mainly just a personal project, however I figure can't hurt to publish it here on Git.

## Application Purpose
This application is designed to take in a dataset containing work data, so to manipulate it and display it through GUI Graphs, tables, etc.

Currently, a parsed table is set up as displayed below; But soon this will be refactored to be dynamic rather than static.

| Weekday | Date | Start Time | End Time | <> | HRS | Hourly Rate | Gross Earned |
|---------|------|------------|----------|----|-----|-------------|--------------|
| Monday  | 7/11 | 5:00am     | 10:00am  | <> | 5   | $30.98      | $154.9       |

Contents of this table will also be refactored. Only requisite information requred are: <br>
Date | Start Time  | End Time | Hourly Rate

## Future Implementations
- TBC
- This README will be updated soon to be more informative, clean, and much less, Jank.
