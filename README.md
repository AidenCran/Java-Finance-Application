# Java Personal Finance Application (AU)
## Overview
Hello There! 
<br>
This is a prototype application created mainly for self-development purposes. This project is intended to assist myself in learning Java development, and software testing where applicable. I'm keeping this repo public to _attempt_ to document my progress, and to keep myself accountable!

### Disclaimer
